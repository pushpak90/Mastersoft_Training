        <p>The United States Department of Education is a Cabinet-level department of the United States government. It
            began operating on May 4, 1980, having been created after the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare
            was split into the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services by the Department
            of Education Organization Act, which President Jimmy Carter signed into law on October 17, 1979.

            The United States Department of Justice (DOJ), also known as the Justice Department, is a federal executive
            department of the United States government tasked with the enforcement of federal law and administration of
            justice in the United States. It is equivalent to the justice or interior ministries of other countries. The
            department is headed by the U.S. attorney general, who reports directly to the president of the United
            States and is a member of the president's Cabinet. The current attorney general is Merrick Garland, who has
            served since March 2021.

            The Ministry of Defence (MoD) (IAST: Rakshā Mantrālaya) is charged with coordinating and supervising all
            agencies and functions of the government relating directly to national security and the Indian Armed Forces.
            The President of India is the ceremonial commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the country. The Ministry
            of Defence provides policy framework and resources to the armed forces to discharge their responsibility in
            the context of the defence of the country. The Indian Armed Forces (including Indian Army, Indian Air Force,
            Indian Navy) and Indian Coast Guard under the Ministry of Defence are primarily responsible for ensuring the
            territorial integrity of India.

            paper currency and minting coins, while the treasury executes currency circulation in the domestic fiscal
            system.
