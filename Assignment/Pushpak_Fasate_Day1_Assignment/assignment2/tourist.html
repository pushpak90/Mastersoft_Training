            henceforth included in the British boundary, and such Military works erected as may be deemed necessary.’ By
            this treaty the British occupied the Sitaburdi hills and large areas on all four sides. However no major
            construction work was erected on it for next two years The area surrounding the hillock, now known as
            Sitabuldi, is an important commercial hub for Nagpur.To the south is Nagpur Railway Station and behind
            it is Tekdi Ganapati, a temple of Ganesha. The fort was a home to the Indian Army's 118th infantry
